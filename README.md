# ITALMUD
ITALMUD is an open multilingual computational terminology built from the Italian translation of the Babylonian Talmud. Terms were extracted from glossaries compiled during ten years of translation work and modeled using the OntoLex-Lemon model. The resource includes over 1,600 terms in Italian, Hebrew, and Aramaic. A key innovation that was introduced involved linking terms to the CompL-it computational lexicon of the Italian language, in order to place the terminology within a rich network of semantic relations and enable more sophisticated linguistic searches. ITALMUD is available as an open resource and conforms to the principles of Linked Open Data to ensure maximum interoperability and reuse.
